# Argo Books

## Introduction

**Argo Books** is easy-to-use accounting software with receipt scanning, predictive analytics, inventory management, and more. Everything you need to run your business. Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It's available for download at www.argorobots.com.

Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite on [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/). Versions 1.x were Windows-only and built on WinForms, and that codebase is preserved at [ArgoRobots/Argo-Books-WinForms](https://github.com/ArgoRobots/Argo-Books-WinForms).

## Features

- **AI Receipt Scanning**: Take a photo of any receipt with your phone or upload from your computer. Our AI automatically extracts vendor, date, amount, and line items with 99% accuracy.
- **Invoicing**: Create, send, and track invoices with ease. Customize templates, set payment terms, and get paid faster.
- **Expense & Revenue Tracking**: An intuitive interface makes recording expenses and revenue simple. Smart input validation prevents errors before they happen.
- **Customer Management**: Keep track of customer information, purchase history, and preferences.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Analyzes your historical data to forecast sales trends, identify seasonal patterns, and help you make data-driven decisions.
- **Inventory Management**: Track stock levels, set reorder points, and never run out of your best-selling items. Real-time visibility across all your products.
- **Rental Management**: Manage equipment rentals, track availability, and handle bookings with ease.
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption protects all your data. Your data stays on your computer, not in the cloud. Biometric authentication support.
