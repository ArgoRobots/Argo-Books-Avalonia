/// <summary>
/// Attached behavior that formats a money box as it is typed in: symbol, thousands separators
/// and all.
///
/// The caret is the whole difficulty. Rewriting the text moves it, so typing into the middle of
/// an existing figure would drop the digits somewhere else. It is preserved by counting the
/// SIGNIFICANT characters before it, the digits and the decimal point, and putting it back after
/// the same count in the rewritten text. Separators are not significant, so inserting one never
/// shifts the caret away from what the typist was aiming at.
///
/// Formatting follows CurrencyInfo.Format exactly: the symbol leads, and the separators are
/// invariant rather than the machine's. That is deliberate there,
/// so a German machine does not render a hybrid like "$1.234,56", and this has to match or the
/// field would reformat itself the moment it lost focus.
///
/// Do NOT also set <see cref="NumericInputBehavior"/>.IsDecimalOnly on the same box. It looks
/// complementary and is not: its TextInput handler builds the text the keystroke WOULD produce
/// and rejects anything that is not bare digits with at most one point. As soon as this behavior
/// writes a symbol, every following keystroke fails that test and the box accepts exactly one
/// digit. Nothing is needed alongside this anyway, because rewriting the text keeps only digits
/// and the first decimal point, so letters and stray separators are dropped as they arrive.
