/// This is the one telemetry event that is NOT anonymous, and it is deliberate: knowing

/// feature counters. A sole trader's company name is frequently their own name, so treat
/// everything here as personal data. It is disclosed in /legal/privacy.php under "Business
/// Profile Data", which is also why that page no longer describes desktop telemetry as
/// anonymous. Adding a field here means changing that page in the same commit, and adding
/// it to the allowlist in api/data/telemetry_filter.php, which drops anything it does not
/// recognise.
