/// Tests for the bonus method: T4127's "Tax calculation formulas for bonuses, retroactive pay
/// increases, and other non-periodic payments".
///
/// The rule being enforced is that a bonus is NOT annualised. Everything else in a pay period
/// recurs, so the engine multiplies it by the number of periods to find the year's income; a
/// bonus is paid once, and multiplying it by 26 invents income the employee will never have. A
/// $5,000 bonus on $2,400 biweekly annualises to $192,400 instead of $67,400, which is three
/// brackets up, and takes about 11% too much out of that one pay.
///
/// The overcharge comes back at year end, which is exactly why the error survives being looked
/// at: nobody is out of pocket in April, they are just short in August.
///
/// CRA's method is a difference: work out the annual tax with the bonus, work it out without,
/// and withhold the gap once rather than dividing it across the year.
///
/// Most cases here set the employee CPP and EI exempt. That is not a realistic pay run; it
/// removes the K2 credit and the enhanced-contribution deduction so that the bracket arithmetic
/// is the only thing left, and an expected figure can be derived from the published constants
/// instead of copied out of this implementation. The interaction with contributions is covered
