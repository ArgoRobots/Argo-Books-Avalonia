/// various <c>OpenCreateX</c> commands.
///
/// The create-modal ViewModels (<c>App.ProductModalsViewModel</c>, etc.) are app-lifetime singletons,
/// so the naive "subscribe to <c>XSaved</c>, unsubscribe on the handler's own first fire" approach
/// leaks the handler whenever the user CANCELS the create modal, because cancel closes the modal
/// without ever raising <c>XSaved</c>. A later, unrelated save of that same entity type (including an
/// undo/redo, which also raises <c>XSaved</c>) would then re-fire the stale handler and clobber the
/// caller's current selection, and every cancel adds another permanent handler.
///
/// <see cref="RearmOnce"/> keeps at most one live handler per call site: it detaches any
/// previously-armed handler before arming a new one-shot handler that detaches itself on fire. This
/// mirrors the guard already used in <c>SettingsModalViewModel.OpenCreateCategory</c>.
