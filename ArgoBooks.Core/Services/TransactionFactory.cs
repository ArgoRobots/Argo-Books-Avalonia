/// OriginalCurrency has deliberately no default. It used to default to "USD",
/// which was silent and only wrong for a company keeping books in another currency: the amount
/// is stored in the company's currency, so labelling it USD made the display convert it at the
/// transaction date and show a pending marker instead of the figure. Every caller knows its own
