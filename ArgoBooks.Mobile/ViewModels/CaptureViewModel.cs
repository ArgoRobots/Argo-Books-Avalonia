/// The Capture tab's root screen: shows which paired company the scan will land in and a
/// best-effort local scan counter, then a shutter plus an "Import from photos" affordance. Both
/// buttons launch the same ML Kit DocumentScanner - its own UI exposes gallery import once
/// SetGalleryImportAllowed is set (see DocumentScanner's doc comment), so there's no separate
/// gallery-only entry point to call. A captured image hands off to ShellViewModel's
/// StartScanFlowAsync callback, which pushes the ScanningView and drives the AI call.
/// Also owns the "Recent scans" list (see <see cref="AddRecentScan"/>): once a scan is confirmed
/// on the review screen and CaptureDeliveryCoordinator has (or hasn't yet) delivered it to the
/// desktop queue, ShellViewModel records it here so the user has some visible confirmation - the
/// phone has no ledger of its own and can't poll for the desktop's ingest, so this is local-only
/// and never checked back against what actually landed on the desktop.
/// Task 6 edge states: once the local free-scan counter (<see cref="ScanUsageStore"/>/
/// <see cref="ScanQuota"/>) reaches the monthly limit, <see cref="IsOverLimit"/> flips and the view
/// swaps to an upgrade prompt (<see cref="UpgradeCommand"/> opens the marketing site in the system
/// browser - no in-app purchase). If a capture happens with no network, the cropped image is
/// queued in <see cref="PendingScanOutbox"/> instead of starting the AI scan flow; once online, the
/// Capture screen shows a "N receipts ready to review" prompt (<see cref="HasPendingOfflineScans"/>)
/// and the user walks each queued receipt through the normal review flow - nothing is auto-posted.
/// Captures waiting on a company that is no longer paired are counted separately
/// (<see cref="StrandedCount"/>): they are neither reviewable nor sendable until it is paired back,
/// and the prompt says so rather than offering a review that could not go anywhere.
