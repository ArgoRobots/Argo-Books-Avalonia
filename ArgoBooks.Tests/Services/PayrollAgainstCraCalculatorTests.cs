/// <summary>
/// The engine against the tax authorities' own calculators.
///
/// Every other payroll test here proves the engine agrees with our reading of T4127. These prove
/// it agrees with CRA, which is a different claim and the one that matters: a misread formula
/// produces a plausible number that reconciles with itself all the way to a T4 and is only
/// caught, months later, by a PIER review against the employee's return.
///
/// The expected values are captured by hand from:
///
///   CRA, Payroll Deductions Online Calculator (PDOC)
///   https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/payroll-deductions-online-calculator.html
///
///   Revenu Quebec, WebRAS, for the Quebec case
///   https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/all-current/webras/
///
/// HOW TO FILL THESE IN
///
/// Each case below names exactly what to enter. Run it through the calculator once, then paste
/// the four figures into the Expected(...) call and delete the Skip on that row. A row still
/// carrying nulls is reported as not yet captured rather than passing quietly.
///
/// Use the payment date each case names, because the deduction tables change on 1 January and
/// 1 July and the calculator asks for the date rather than the year.
///
/// WHEN THEY DISAGREE
///
/// Assume the engine is wrong before assuming the calculator is. Tolerance is one cent, which is
/// rounding; anything larger is a real difference and worth understanding before it is adjusted
/// away. Do not edit an expected value to make a test pass.
///
/// Recapture these when the January rate edition lands. They are dated, so a stale row is
/// visible rather than silently wrong. See docs/Payroll rate updates.md.
