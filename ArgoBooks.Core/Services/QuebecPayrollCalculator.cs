/// Source deductions for an employee working in Quebec, following Revenu Quebec's TP-1015.F.
///
/// A separate calculator rather than a branch inside the federal one, because Quebec is not a
/// province-shaped problem. Three things differ in kind, not degree:
///
/// The pension plan is QPP, at 6.30% split as a 5.30% base plus a 1.00% first additional
/// contribution. CPP is 5.95% split 4.95 and 1.00, so neither the rate nor the split carries
/// over.
///
/// There is a parental insurance plan, QPIP, with no equivalent anywhere else in Canada, and
/// Quebec employees pay a LOWER EI rate because of it.
///
/// The income tax formula is not CRA's shape at all. Quebec has a deduction for workers that
/// comes off income, relieves personal credits at a stated rate rather than at the lowest
/// bracket rate, and gives no credit for QPP or QPIP: the additional QPP is relieved as a
/// deduction instead. Writing this by analogy with the federal formula would produce numbers
/// that look reasonable and are wrong.
///
/// CRA reduces federal tax by an abatement for Quebec residents, to make room for Quebec's own
/// income tax. That is applied here rather than federally, because it only ever applies here.
